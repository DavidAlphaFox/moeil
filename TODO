* Alias without username works as domain catch-all; Møil does not allow a blank
  username. Maybe there is an elegant solution for this.
* Make encrypted_password on mailboxes editable by admins.
* Maybe logging of Logins to IMAP and/or to Møil would be a handy feature.
* Delete domain, revert change and delete again results in 500 on versions
  index.
